# LeaseCar

This project aims to implement a web-based car rental service which provides an online platform for the passengers who want to lease a car with its driver.

# How the system works

In order to start using the system, registration is needed for both passenger and driver. In the registration process, it is essential to specify for which type of user you are signing up for the system. When passengers and drivers log in to the system, different panels welcome them based on their user type.

In driver panel, the drivers are able to see their average ratings, the number of rides they did, the total fee they are paid. Furthermore, they can view their upcoming rides. Lastly, they have another two page for registering their vehicles and for editing their profiles.

As for the passengers, they can monitor their upcoming and recent rides in the home page. If there are more than 24 hours left for a ride, they will have an option to cancel their rides and they will be refunded. In addition, after they are done with their rides, they will be able to add a review about their rides. They can vote for the driver and make a comment regarding their experience.

For scheduling a new ride, the passenger firstly need to search for the city and starting date of his/her ride using search form. Then, all the available drivers for that location and time will be listed. Here, the passenger should decide on a vehicle for their ride and click the “lease” button. Clicking lease button, they will be directed to Lease.aspx page. Here, they choose the starting and ending dates of their trips and they can write some description for the driver. When they press the pay button, they will be charged using their credit card. They will have an option to cancel their rides and be refunded if there are more than 24 hours prior to their rides.
